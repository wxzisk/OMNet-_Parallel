  <h2 id="_omnet_5_4_june_2018">OMNeT++ 5.4 (June 2018)</h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
  <div class="paragraph"><p>This release contains last-minute features and improvements, mostly motivated
  by the upcoming INET 4 release. Highlights are the typename and exists()
  operators in NED; nan and inf keywords in NED; support for logarithmic units
  like dB, dBW, dBm, dBV, dBmV. Qtenv has also gained much more powerful
  just-in-time debugging capabilities than before.</p></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Details follow.</p></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>NED:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Allow 'typename' in expressions. Motivation: we want to be able to write:
       foo: &lt;&gt; like IFoo if typename!=""
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Added the "exists" operator. Syntax: exists(&lt;submodulename&gt;)
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Introduced "nan" and "inf" as keywords for numeric constants
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  SimTime now has a new method named ustr() that prints the time in an
      appropriate unit. It is now used in cClassDescriptor for displaying
      simtime_t fields and at a few other places.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  SimTime: more precise computation for integer-SimTime division.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Measurement units are now available as NED functions as well. They
      accept dimensionless numbers and quantities with a compatible unit.
      E.g. the expressions mW(2*100) and mW(0.2W) both result in 200mW.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  New measurement units: K, Ohm, mOhm, kOhm, MOhm, uW, nW, pW, fW,
      THz, kmps, binary and decimal multiples of bit (Kib, Mib, Gib,
      Tib, kb, Mb); deg, rad; pct (percent), ratio.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Support for logarithmic units: dBW, dBm, dBV, dBmV, dBA, dBmA, dB.
      Conversion between logarithmic and corresponding linear units (W vs. dBW)
      is supported. Conversion between bit and byte (and multiples) is
      also supported.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  cPacket: refined str() method
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Several smaller improvements.
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Qtenv:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Debug-on-error functionality can now be turned on interactively, via the
      Simulate -&gt; Debug on Errors menu item.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  When an error occurs and debug-on-error is enabled, Qtenv now offers to
      launch and attach an external debugger unless the simulation program is
      already being debugged. The same applies to the Debug Next Event
      functionality. External debuggers can be configured with the
      debugger-attach-command configuration key, and can also be overridden
      with the OMNETPP_DEBUGGER_COMMAND environment variable.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Workaround for a crash with Qt 5.11.
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>IDE:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Launcher: fix: The IDE sometimes started build in the UI thread,
      locking up the UI for the time of the build, potentially for several
      minutes.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed "unknown" image as module background in the graphical NED editor.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Fix: do not report "undefined parameter" for typename assignments in NED
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Fix: inifile analysis: typename deep assignments in NED were ignored
  </p>
  </li>

  <h2 id="_omnet_5_3_april_2018">OMNeT++ 5.3 (April 2018)</h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Highlights of this release are an improved message compiler (required for INET 4),
  much improved histogram support, a more powerful cMessagePrinter API and its
  implementation in Qtenv, and better support for smooth animation in Qtenv.
  Details follow.</p></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Revised message compiler, added import support and more.
      See src/nedxml/ChangeLog for details. Use --msg6 to turn on
      the new features.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  cPar: integer representation changed from long to int64_t.
      See src/include/omnetpp/ChangeLog for details.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Evaluation of NED expressions now uses integer arithmetic when operands
      are integers. Conversions that incur precision loss should now be explicit:
      converting a double to integer requires the int() cast; also, converting
      an int to double will raise an error if there is actual precision loss,
      and you can suppress that error by explicit double() cast. There are many
      smaller-scale changes related to this change&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;see include/omnetpp/ChangeLog
      for details.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  cHistogram has been replaced with new implementation. (The old one is still
      available under the name cLegacyHistogram.) The new cHistogram is more
      general (supports arbitrary bins), more configurable, and produces much
      higher quality histograms even in the default setup due to newly introduced
      techniques such as adaptive precollection, bin size rounding and bin edge
      snapping, auto-extension with new bins, bin merging to keep the number of
      bins optimal, etc. Histogram operation can be customized via histogram
      strategy classes (cIHistogramStrategy); several histogram strategies are
      provided.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  In recording histograms with @statistic, the number of bins can be specified
      by adding numBins=nn: @statistic[x](record=histogram;numBins=100). The actual
      number of bins produced might slightly differ, due to auto-extension and
      bn merging during result collection.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  cMessagePrinter: API was extended with tags and column names
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  cCanvas: added getAnimationSpeed(); better documentation for
      setAnimationSpeed() and holdSimulationFor().
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  cHistogram, cNedValue: minor changes in the public API
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Result recorders: Added "timeWeightedHistogram" recorder
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Qtenv:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Implemented support for the improved cMessagePrinter Options API, and added
      a respective configuration dialog.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  The log viewer now supports ANSI control sequences for text styling:
      foreground/background color, and bold/italic/underline text. Styling is
      supported in both message history view and log view, i.e. it can be used
      in text returned from cMessagePrinter and logged by the EV and other logging
      macros.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>

  Rewritten the controller for smooth animation. The new algorithm is now able
      to scale linearly, as long as the simulation can keep up.

  <li>
  <p>
  Usability improvements in the Animation Parameters dialog, e.g. it now
      also displays the current simulation speed, and it is colored red if the
      simulation cannot keep up with the requested animation speed.

  The Tcl/Tk based runtime interface is now deprecated and turned off by

  'march=native' and 'mtune=native' compiler options are no longer used

  <h2 id="_omnet_5_2_september_2017">OMNeT++ 5.2 (September 2017)</h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Highlights of this release are the fine-tuning of result recording and processing
  (especially around weighted statistics); many bug fixes and improvements in Qtenv;
  makefile changes to allow DEBUG and RELEASE builds of models to co-exist, and
  several related changes in the IDE.</p></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Figure zIndex is now additive: the effective zIndex is now the sum of the
     zIndex values of the figure and all its ancestors up to the root figure.
     This provides more flexibility, as the stacking order of figures
     is no longer constrained by their position in the figure tree.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Added cPanelFigure, a new figure type that turns off zoom for its children.
     cPanelFigure is handy when one needs to do relative positioning unaffected
     by zoom, for example when adding decorations next to submodule icons.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Statistics recording: added support for collecting time-weighted
     statistics. This is useful for variables like queue length. Add
     timeWeighted=1 or timeWeighted=true to a @statistic to make it collect
     time-weighted statistics. timeWeighted=1 affects the operation of the
     following filters/recorders: "mean", "stats" and "histogram". The "timeavg"
     recorder always computes time average; an additional recorder "avg" has
     also been added that always computes unweighted mean. "mean" emulates
     either "avg" or "timeavg", depending on the presence of the timeWeighted=1
     option.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Changed result filters/recorders so that they interpret NaN as "missing data"
     and ignore it. The change affects "count" (which now also ignores nullptrs),
     "sum", "min", "max", "avg", "timeavg", "sumPerDuration", "stats", "histogram".
     For the time weighted case, NaNs mark intervals to be ignored.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  cResultFilter: added an init() method to allow filters access the content
     of the @statistic property they occur in.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  The packetBytes/packetBits filter now throw error if object is not a cPacket.
     They still accept (and ignore) nullptr.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Added support for weighted statistics to histogram classes and to cStddev
     (the cWeightedStddev class is no longer needed.) The primary motivation
     for weighted statistics is the existence of variables where time average
     makes much more sense than arithmetic mean, e.g. queue length.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  The OSG viewer was factored out from Qtenv into a separate support library
     which is only loaded at runtime on demand. Core OMNeT++ no longer has
     any dependence on OSG or OSGEarth. This change improves simulation
     startup times and also debugging experience, as it eliminates the loading
     of the huge number of shared libraries that OSG and OSGEarth depends on.
     (The library loading overhead was also present in simulations that did not
     even contain 3D visualization.) The only API change is that one must use
     cOsgCanvas::EarthViewpoint instead of osgEarth::Viewpoint when using
     the cOsgCanvas::setEarthViewpoint().

  </li>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Build:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  opp_makemake: IMPORTANT CHANGES regarding debug/release-mode builds:
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Models are built in RELEASE mode by default. Until now, DEBUG was the
       default, which resulted in casual users always running their simulations
       in DEBUG mode, i.e. much slower than possible.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  RELEASE and DEBUG mode binaries can now co-exist, so users do not have
       to recompile when they switch modes (e.g. when they want to debug a
       simulation.) This is a significant gain especially for large models
       like INET. The goal was achieved by adding the "_dbg" suffix to the
       names of DEBUG-mode binaries so they don&#8217;t collide with RELEASE-mode
       ones.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Binaries are now hard-linked from the build directory (out/) to the
       target directory instead of being soft-linked. This leaves the copy
       in the build directory intact when the one in the target directory
       is deleted.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Refinements on the build process of OMNeT++ itself: generated files are
     created only once, even when using parallel build; do not copy build
     artifacts if not actually changed; Makefiles in the samples/ folder
     are re-created only if they are missing; etc.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  The samples/ folder is now optional: deleting it in an OMNeT++ installation
     will no longer break the build.
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Base:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  The Eclipse platform was updated to the latest Oxygen milestone build (4.6.2)
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Build:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>

  Models are built in RELEASE mode by default. Until now, DEBUG was the
     default, which resulted in casual users always running their simulations
     in DEBUG mode, i.e. much slower than possible.
  </p>
  </li>

     simulation&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;remember, they are built in RELEASE mode by default.)
     This is a significant gain especially for large models like INET.

     is deleted.
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Launching:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  The Run, Profile and Debug launch types now automatically trigger build.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  The launcher now switches the project (and optionally all projects it
     depends on) to the appropriate build configuration if necessary: Run
     and Profile will perform RELEASE build, Debug will perform DEBUG build.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  For Debug launch, the "_dbg" suffix is added implicitly to the target
     name (both exe and shared lib). (The simulations will also load the
     "_dbg" versions of libraries when compiled to DEBUG.)
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  A new "Build before launch" section was added to the Launch config
     dialog, which allows you to control whether to switch build configuration
     automatically or to ask before the build. The scope of build can also
     configured; options are: "None", "This project", or "Project + dependencies".
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  If the launch is configured as "Ask before build" (default), a
     confirmation dialog is shown on launch (and before the build), asking
     whether to switch the active build configuration to the appropriate one.
     The dialog allows you to set the decision as permanent and reconfigures
     the launch config accordingly.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Better progress reporting and cancellation for batch runs. Internally,
     this is the result of switching to the new JobGroups API of Eclipse.
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Analysis Tool:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Added support for "statistic" items and for weighted statistics.
     Background: Specifying "record=stats" in a @statistic NED property, or
     or calling the record() method on a cStddDev object saves a "statistic"
     object in the output scalar file. A "statistic" object includes fields
     like the count of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum
     and maximum value. "statistic" objects so far have been blown up to
     several unrelated scalars upon loading into the Analysis Tool. Now they
     are loaded as objects, and appear in the Histograms and All tabs of the
     Browse Data page. Statistics fields continue to be available as scalars
     as well, so they can be used as chart input.
     Also, weighted statistics (like those saved from cWeightedStddev) were
     not properly displayed in the Analysis Tool. This has been rectified
     as well. Details:
  </p>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  The Histograms tab on the Browse Data page now includes "statistics"-
       type results as well.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  The Histograms tab now has new table columns: "Kind", "SumWeights",
       "#Bins", "Hist.Range", all displayed by default. "Kind" indicates
       whether a result item is a "statistic" or a "histogram", and whether
       it is weighted or unweighted.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Individual fields of "statistic" and "histogram" result items are
       no longer displayed on the Scalars page.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Properties for "statistic" and "histogram" result items now includes
       "Kind" ("weighted"/"unweighted") and "Sum of weights".
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  On the All tab of Browse Data page, result item fields are now in
       natural order (i.e. no longer alphabetically sorted).
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Export dialog refined: Added "Open exported file afterwards" checkbox,
     better filename generation and validation, etc.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Changed the syntax for accessing iteration variables in filter
     expressions. Before, they could be accessed like run attributes,
     with the "attr:" prefix. Now, one needs to use the "itervar:" prefix,
     which is more explicit.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Properties view: properly display attributes, iteration variables and
     parameter assignments for runs
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Better display of histogram bins in the Properties view.
     The display format of bins was changed from "a..b" to "[a,b)", in order
     to clearly indicate that "a" is inclusive and "b" is exclusive.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  The "Variance" line has been removed from Properties view because
     it&#8217;s not too useful and can be easily computed as the square of the
     standard deviation.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Missing or unavailable data in table cells is now displayed with a
     hyphen instead of "n.a."
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  New icon for scalar items on the All tab of Browse Data page
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Qtenv:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  OSG Viewer is now a separate library, loaded at runtime.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Improved the appearance and usability of the Animation Parameters dialog.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Show (debug) or (release) in the window title based on NDEBUG.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Completely overhauled figure rendering. This should improve performance
      and fix many issues.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  The size of arrowheads on connections and line figures is now more
      reasonable with many combinations of zoom level, line width, and the
      "zoomLineWidth" property.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Implemented cPanelFigure support and cumulative zIndex.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Figures without a tooltip inherit it from their nearest ancestor
      that has one. Empty strings break this inheritance, but are not shown.
      The own tooltip of the figure now overrides that of its associated object.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  The special value "kind" is now also accepted as a color in the "i" tag
      of display strings of messages as well.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  A large number of miscellaneous improvements, fixes and cleanups;
      see src/qtenv/ChangeLog.

  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Envir:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  EnvirBase: changed the lifecycle of several plugin objects to per-run,
     i.e. those objects are now deleted and re-created between runs. Affected
     plugins: event log recorder, output vector file recorder, output scalar
     file recorder, snapshot recorder, future event set (FES).
     The corresponding configuration options have also become per-run options:
     eventlogmanager-class=, outputvectormanager-class=, outputscalarmanager-class=,
     snapshotmanager-class=, futureeventset-class=.
     Side effect: in output vector files, vector IDs now start again from 0
     at the start of each run when running multiple runs. Before, they continued
     from where the previous run left off.
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Scavetool:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>

  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Sort runs by runId, for consistent query output
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  JSON and CSV exporter changes (applies to IDE Analysis Tool as well):
  </p>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Python export changed to JSON export with optional Python flavour
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  CSV export renamed to "CSV for spreadsheet" and significantly improved
       (also saves iteration variables for better run identification, etc.)
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  another CSV export added ("CSV Records"), provenly suitable as input
       for the read_csv() of Python Pandas
  </p>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  </li>
  </ul></div>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Result recording and processing:</p></div>
  <div class="ulist"><ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Switch to new scalar/vector file recorders: The default values for
     the outputscalarmanager-class= and outputvectormanager-class= config
     options are now the new classes OmnetppOutputScalarManager and
     OmnetppOutputVectorManager. These classes rely on the new result
     file writer classes in common/.
     The old classes cIndexedFileOutVectorManager and cFileOutScalarManager
     still exist. They will be removed in a later version of OMNeT++.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Save iteration variables separately from run attributes ("itervar"
     lines). NOTE: This changes result file format!
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  omnetpp recorders: ensure order of "param" lines in the file mirror the
     order in the ini file
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Output scalar file recorders: sum and sqrSum are no longer saved for
     weighted statistics. This is to follow recent cStddev/cWeightedStddev
     change.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Output scalar files: do not save numeric iteration variables (of
     parameter studies) as scalars. Instead we&#8217;ll add them (as scalars)
     at load time, if needed.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Proper loading and exporting of weighted statistics
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Added StatisticsResult (HistogramResult sans histogram). Until now,
     statistic results in scalar files were loaded as several unrelated
     scalars, and were not available as a single object.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  OmnetppResultFileLoader: fix: 'run' line is mandatory since version 4.0
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  SqliteResultFileLoader: updated: histBin table was renamed to histogramBin
  </p>

<h2 id="_omnet_5_1_preview_2_december_2016">OMNeT++ 5.1 Preview 2 (December 2016)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This release significantly improves and builds upon functionality introduced
in version 5.0, and also raises the bar in other areas. Highlights include:
a much-improved Qtenv that now replaces Tkenv as the default runtime GUI;
support for smooth custom animation and video recording; better support for
simulation campaigns in managing and performing a large number of runs and in
result recording/processing; experimental support for SQLite-based result
files; updated toolchain and libraries on Windows; 64-bit Windows support;
updated Eclipse base for the IDE.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
The manuals have not yet been updated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There are now separate downloads for Linux, Windows and macOS. A fourth
   package labelled "core" comes without the IDE, and can be used on all other
   systems.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
32-bit Windows and Linux are no longer supported.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Changes since version 5.0:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Support for smooth custom animations. The goal was to allow models to visualize
   their operation using sophisticated animations while the simulation is running
   under a GUI (Qtenv). The key idea is that refreshDisplay() is called repeatedly
   at a reasonable rate to render frames. refreshDisplay() knows the animation
   position from the simulation time (which is now interpolated between events)
   and the "animation time", a variable also made accessible to the model.
   Animation-to-simulation speed ratio (sec/simsec) is determined by an "animation speed"
   variable (or rather, several such variables) that can be set explicitly from code.
   Different animation speeds can be chosen dynamically to adapt the animation
   to the current time scale of the interesting events or processes in the simulation.
   Animations that need to take place in zero simulation time are supported
   with "holds", i.e. holding up the simulation for a certain animation time period.
   The actual playing speed of the resulting animation can be controlled in Qtenv
   using the "Speed" slider on the toolbar. Note that this feature is only available
   in Qtenv (and not in Tkenv which is more-or-less in maintenance mode from now on).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If a model implements such full-blown animations for a compound module that
   OMNeT++'s default animations (message sending/method call animations) become
   a liability, they can now be programmatically turned off for that module with
   a setBuiltinAnimationsAllowed(false) call.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for self-refreshing figures. cFigure now has a refreshDisplay()
   method which is called on every display refresh as long as the containing
   canvas is open in the GUI. Overriding that method in custom figure classes
   allows the figure to update itself according to the state of the simulation.
   The self-refreshing feature is especially useful for figures that implement
   various meters, gauges, plots or charts, because this way they don&#8217;t require
   an additional helper module to update them. Note this feature is only available
   in Qtenv.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Custom figure classes are now registered using Register_Figure(), not with
   Register_Class(). This allows for more flexibility and a cleaner handling of
   C&#x2060;+&#x2060;+ namespaces.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The stacking order of figures is now jointly determined by the child order and
   a new runtime-settable cFigure member called zIndex, with the latter taking
   priority. In @figure properties in NED files, "zIndex" replaces "childZ" which
   was only used at parse time but not stored in figures afterwards.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A figure can now have a tooltip text set.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A figure can now be associated with a simulation object, for example a module
   or a packet. Association means that the figure more-or-less "stands for" (or
   visually represents) the other object in the GUI. For example, when the user
   clicks or double-clicks the figure under Qtenv, the associated object is
   focused or opened in the GUI. The figure also "inherits" the tooltip of its
   associated object, provided it does not have its own tooltip.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
For text figures, one can now optionally turn on a "halo", which makes the
   text more readable on all backgrounds.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support has been added to load custom images for use by cImageFigure/cIconFigure
   and in display strings (cEnvir::loadImage()). It is also possible now to
   programmatically add new directories to the image path (cEnvir::appendToImagePath()).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The dimensions of images used by cImageFigure/cIconFigure can now be determined
   programmatically (getImageNaturalWidth() / getImageNaturalHeight() methods).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for measuring the text has been added to cTextFigure and cLabelFigure
   (getBounds() method). Note that getBounds() assumes zoom level 1.0.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for accessing the coordinates of auto-layouted submodules (cEnvir::
   getSubmoduleBounds()). This functionality is needed by some visualizers in
   INET, where nodes of a wired network are typically not explicitly placed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In cObject and subclasses, info() has been renamed to str(). The old method
   still exists and delegates to the new one. The detailedInfo() method has been
   deprecated due to lack of usefulness.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In NED statistic declarations (@statistic), signal names in the "source"
   attribute can now be qualified with the name of a submodule. This will cause
   the signal listener to be added to the given submodule instead of the module
   containing the @statistic. Example: @statistic[foo](source=a.b.foo). Note that
   there is no syntax to specify modules above or outside the one containing the
   @statistic, as that would limit the module&#8217;s reusability (encapsulation
   violation).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In cModule, the arrived() method has been made public API. arrived() is
   invoked as part of the send() protocol, and its default version inserts the
   message into the FES after some bookkeeping. Overriding arrived() allows one
   to perform custom processing at the destination module of a send() call
   immediately, still within the send() call.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cPacket&#8217;s default getDisplayString() method now falls back to returning the
   encapsulated packet&#8217;s display string, instead of just returning an empty string.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When formatting error messages, location/time information is now placed *after*
   the exception text, not before. The goal was to improve readability, as user
   now needs to go through less blabla before getting to the actual error message.
   Individual error messages have also been revised for brevity and consistency
   (capitalization, use of quotation marks, etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Several things have been made inspectable at runtime (e.g. from Qtenv):
   simulation results being collected (i.e. result filter/recorder objects
   added via @statistic); per-signal listeners lists; values of XML module
   parameters and cXMLElement trees.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Unit conversion now knows about C (coulomb) and related units As, mAs, Ah, mAh.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Many other smaller-scale changes, fixes and refactoring, in part related to
   the ones above; see ChangeLogs under src/ for details.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Qtenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Qtenv has reached maturity and it is now the default GUI for simulations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Qtenv now requires Qt5.4, and optionally OpenSceneGraph 3.2-3.5 and
   osgEarth 2.5-2.7.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
You can use your own Qt bundle by setting the QT_PATH variable in
   configure.user before running ./configure. (This may be needed if your Linux
   distribution comes with an older version.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added support for smooth custom animations. This means that simulation time is
   interpolated between events, and the animation can be stopped between events.
   In the event number display, the event number is prefixed with either 'last:'
   or 'next:' to make it unambiguous. A new 'Animation Parameters' window has
   been added where one can view the current animation speed, framerate, and
   other metrics.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
One-stepping now stops right before events so pressing F4 will execute the
   next event instantly. For consistency, after initialization, the simulation
   time will be set to that of the first event (not always to 0s).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The simulation time display now has digit grouping and units turned on by
   default for better readability. Settings can be changed in the context menu.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added built-in support to record animation into a high quality video.
   (Press the record button on the toolbar for instructions.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements on built-in animations: Messages sent with a nonzero propagation
   delay are now animated properly (not instantaneously). Packets of nonzero
   length are now displayed as "strips" when transmitted on a link with a
   transmission rate and propagation delay. The animation of method call
   hierarchies now represents the call graph better.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Two-way connections are now drawn as two half-length lines so that they
   don&#8217;t cover one another.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Module layouts are now shared among all graphical inspectors of the same
   module. Layout seeds are now persistent between runs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Configuration/Run selection dialog now accepts run filters from the
   command line and will display the matching runs on the top of the list.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Inspector windows made persistent between runs and will be re-opened on
   simulation restart.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Other improvements, including tweaks to the Preferences dialog, context
   menu usability in inspectors, updated application and toolbar icons, a new
   'Rebuild network' button on the toolbar, and many bug fixes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Experimental support to run as a native Wayland client (start the simulation
   with the QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland environment variable set).
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
While Qtenv is now the default runtime GUI, simulations can still be
   launched under Tkenv by adding "-u Tkenv" to the command line. Tkenv is
   being maintained, but it is not actively developed any more. This means
   that most new features, including the ones added in this OMNeT++ release
   (smooth custom animations, self-refreshing figures, etc) will not be
   available under Tkenv.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Envir:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Run filtering: The -r option of simulations now also accepts a run filter
   expression as an alternative to a list of run numbers and run number ranges.
   This makes it possible to use the values of iteration variables for filtering,
   instead of the artificial and more-or-less meaningless run number. The new
   -q option (see below) can be used to query the list of matching runs.
   Example: ./aloha -c PureAlohaExperiment -r '$numHosts&gt;5 and $numHosts&lt;10' -q runs
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To query the list of matching runs, the new -q &lt;what&gt; option can be used
   together with -c &lt;config&gt; and -r &lt;runfilter&gt;. The argument to -q can be
   any of: "numruns", "runnumbers", "runs", "rundetails", "runconfig",
   "sectioninheritance".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The nesting order of iterations has been made configurable, and the default
   has changed: the repeat counter has been switched from being the innermost
   loop to being the outermost one. This is more practical, as it allows one
   to get early results for all data points, then refine the picture as more
   runs are being completed. The nesting order (also among iteration variables)
   can be specified using the new iteration-nesting-order configuration
   option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bugfix: the constraint option did not take effect when specified on the
   command line (--constraint=&#8230;)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The -s (silent, i.e. non-verbose) option has been added, partly to facilitate
   machine processing of -q output.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
By default, error messages are written to stderr. A -m (merge output) option
   has been added that redirects errors to stdout; a practical benefit is that
   it preserves the relative order of the output.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Default result file naming scheme been changed to be more practical. The
   traditional naming scheme contained the run number, which has now been
   replaced by the values of the iteration variables and the repetition
   counter. Example: old: Aloha-16.sca, new: Aloha-numHosts=10,mean=0.9-#3.sca.
   Illegal and inconvenient characters are encoded in an urlencode-like manner.
   This naming scheme applies to cmdenv output files, eventlog files and
   snapshot files as well.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Experimental support for SQLite as result file format. SQLite result files
   can be browsed using existing GUI tools (SQLite Browser, SQLite Studio),
   can be queried using SQL, and can be accessed and manipulated from all
   major programming languages including Python and R. These benefits are
   in exchange for slight performance penalty. SQLite result files contain
   the same information as OMNeT++ native result files, they can co-exist,
   and OMNeT++ tools and the IDE understand both. To switch to SQLite as
   default result file format, compile OMNeT++ with PREFER_SQLITE_RESULT_FILES=yes
   set in configure.user. To use SQLite only for specific simulations,
   add the following lines to their omnetpp.ini files:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content monospaced">
<pre>outputvectormanager-class="omnetpp::envir::SqliteOutputVectorManager"
outputscalarmanager-class="omnetpp::envir::SqliteOutputScalarManager"</pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In output scalar files, when run attributes (iteration variables, etc.)
   are saved as scalars, the module name they are saved with has been changed
   from "." to "_runattrs_".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The cpu-time-limit option has been fixed to work as expected; a new
   real-time-limit option also has been added.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cmdenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
All changes described in the Envir section above apply, plus:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When performing multiple runs, Cmdenv now stops after the first run that
   stops with an error. This behavior can be controlled with the new
   cmdenv-stop-batch-on-error=&lt;bool&gt; option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When performing multiple runs, Cmdenv now prints run statistics at the end.
   Example output: "Run statistics: total 42, successful 30, errors 1, skipped 11"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The cmdenv-output-file option can now be specified per run, and now has a
   default file name that follows the naming scheme of result files (but with
   the .out extension). Since saving the output can no longer be
   disabled by omitting the cmdenv-output-file setting, new option
   cmdenv-redirect-output=&lt;bool&gt; has been added for that purpose.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The cmdenv-interactive option can now be specified on per-run basis.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tools:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
scavetool: The command-line interface (options and help) has been redesigned
   for usability.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
scavetool: The tool now supports querying the contents of result files
   in a user-friendly way, via the new "query" subcommand. This subcommand
   has also been made the default operation mode. For example, a simple
   "scavetool *.vec *.sca" command reports the number of runs, vectors and
   scalars found in the specified files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
scavetool: CSV and other tabular export has been improved: run attributes
   (iteration variables, etc) are now added to the output as columns.
   Note that scavetool currently cannot export to SQLite.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
opp_makemake: OMNeT++ and generated model makefiles now use compiler-
   generated dependencies (gcc/clang -MMD option) that are saved in the
   out/ directory in *.d files. "make depend" is no longer needed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
opp_makemake: Support for deep includes (automatically adding each
   subfolder to the include path) has been dropped, due to being error-prone
   and having limited usefulness. In projects that used this feature,
   #include directives need to be updated to include the directory as well.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
opp_makemake: Removed support for generating nmake-compatible makefiles,
   as we now use GNU Make on all platforms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
opp_featuretool: Symbols for enabled features (e.g. WITH_IPv4 for the IPv4
   feature in INET) are now placed into a generated header file, instead of being
   passed to the compiler via -D options. The name of header file can be
   specified in the feature definition file (.oppfeatures).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
opp_runall has been reimplemented in Python, and its command-line interface
   has been redesigned to not only allow using multiple CPUs but also several
   runs per Cmdenv instance. (This change allows one to execute a large number
   of short simulation efficiently by reducing process startup overhead.)
   Internally, opp_runall now uses the new "-q" option of simulations to
   expand a run filter expression to a list of runs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
opp_test: export "run" script and "retest" scripts under work/ for each test,
   to facilitate running tests manually. Minor bug fixes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed unused utilities like opp_makedep, lcg32_seedtool, abspath, and
   some others.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The IDE is now based on Eclipse 4.6 Neon and CDT 9.0 (Java 1.8 required).
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/C&#x2060;+&#x2060;+ Build:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The "Collecting includes&#8230;" phase of project build (that could take quite
   a significant amount of time, and was often seen as a pain point) has been
   eliminated. The key was to switch from IDE-generated dependencies to
   compiler-generated dependencies (see corresponding opp_makemake change)
   that made include analysis in the IDE redundant.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Change in "Project Features" feature: Preprocessor symbols for enabled
   features (e.g. the WITH_IPv4 macro for the IPv4 feature) are now placed
   into a generated header file, and not added to the build configuration
   (Paths &amp; Symbols page) as macros to be passed to the compiler via -D
   options. The name of header file is part of the feature definition file
   (.oppfeatures). Using a generated header file reduces the number of things
   that can go wrong during indexing and project build, and also has the
   advantage of being seen from derived projects.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The "Export build tester makefile" button has been removed from the
   Project Features property page. The INET Framework project now has an
   opp_featuretool-based shell script for the same purpose (tests/featuretest)
   that can be easily adapted to other projects as well.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for deep includes (automatically adding each subfolder to the
   include path) has been dropped from the IDE as well, due to being error-
   prone and having limited usefulness.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements in the Makemake Options dialog that opens from the Makemake
   project property page. For example, an "Include directories" listbox has
   been added to the Compile tab page, and less frequently used options
   on the same page have been moved under the More&gt;&gt;&gt; link.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
CDT integration: renamed the default C/C&#x2060;+&#x2060;+ project configuration names
   from "gcc-debug"/"gcc-release" to simply "debug" and "release".
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Simulation Launching:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
In the Run/Debug Configurations dialog, the "OMNeT++ Simulation" form page
   has been revised for usability and to better support simulation campaigns.
   The launcher (code that schedules and actually runs the simulations and
   arranges feedback in the Progress view and the Console) has also been
   improved. Details follow.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The "Runs" form field now accepts a run filter expression that can refer
   to iteration variables. (This form field corresponds to the -r option of
   simulations.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Batch execution of simulations is now controlled with two new spinner
   widgets: "Number of CPUs to use", "Runs per process".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The form page now allows specifying time limits for the simulation
   ("Simulation time limit", "CPU time limit" fields)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Radio buttons have been replaced by tri-state checkboxes (with on/off/grayed
   states, where the grayed state means "no setting specified, let the inifile
   setting take effect".) The consequent space saving allowed other options
   to be added to the form page: "Verbose", "Stop batch on error", "Express
   mode", "Save stdout", "Record scalar results", "Record vector results",
   "Record eventlog".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
User interface selection now also uses an editable combo instead of
   radio buttons.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added content assist for Additional Arguments field.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improvements in the launcher: Simulation batches are now easier to cancel;
   in case of a simulation error, the error dialog now correctly displays
   the error message, not just a "Finished with error" text.

In the Browse Data page, display Experiment/Measurement/Replication columns
   instead of Folder/Filename/RunId/Config/RunNumber. Note that this is just

Initial support for SQLite result files. From the end user perspective,
   they should work exactly as OMNeT++ result files.

aloha: The updated example highlights the use of the new smooth animation
   API. The server and all hosts now have fixed positions (still random but
   deterministic, and not using auto-layouting), so that their individual
   propagation delays can be computed. Each transmitted packet is visualized
   with a ring and many concentric circles, illustrating the propagation of the
   electromagnetic wave. The visualization is faithful, e.g. multiple signals
   visually overlapping at a receiver actually means a collision. Animation
   speed is controlled by each node, taking three parameters for different
   states (idle, transmission edge, midtransmission) into account.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
osg-earth: Made the mobile nodes in the 'Boston streets' configuration more
   easily noticeable by increasing their sizes, and adding a color parameter.
   Movement trails have been raised off the ground a bit to avoid Z-fighting
   glitches.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
osg-satellites: Refactored mobility logic and replaced the discontinued
   MapQuest public tile source with a single offline image to avoid dependency
   on external sources.
</p>

<li>
<p>
queueinglib: Fixed a race condition by requiring the PassiveQueue to allocate
   the Server before sending a job to it.

<h2 id="_omnet_5_0_rc1_march_2016">OMNeT++ 5.0 rc1 (March 2016)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This release brings numerous refinements to APIs introduced in previous beta
versions, several bug fixes, and relatively few new features. The manual has
been improved and brought up to date for the most part, although there are
still gaps that will be filled in for the final 5.0 release. The most
conspicuous change will be the new simulation time display in Tkenv and Qtenv.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Build:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Introduced WITH_TKENV, WITH_QTENV, WITH_OSG and WITH_SYSTEMC in configure.user;
   these options allow one to disable certain features if they are not needed.
   In particular, WITH_TKENV=no replaces NO_TCL=1
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The logging API was refined. In addition to several renames (e.g.
   GLOBAL_COMPILETIME_LOGLEVEL was changed to COMPILETIME_LOGLEVEL), the
   numeric order of log level constants (LOGLEVEL_*) was reversed to make
   the values consistent with semantics, and LOGLEVEL_OFF was added to allow
   one completely disable logging. Support for log filtering was added in the
   form of compile-time and runtime predicates. The default compile-time
   log levels were also changed (to TRACE in debug builds, and DETAIL in
   release builds).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the OpenSceneGraph API, OmnetppObjectNode was renamed to cObjectOsgNode.
   Static cOsgCanvas methods that existed for creating and manipulating such
   nodes (createOmnetppObjectNode(), isOmnetppObjectNode(), setOmnetppObject(),
   getOmnetppObject()) were removed, and one should directly use cObjectOsgNode
   instead. Also, the osgutil.h header is now part of omnetpp.h, so it doesn&#8217;t
   need to be included separately.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In cOsgCanvas, the redundant setPerspective() method was removed (it was a
   union of two other setters).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There were several refinements in the cFigure API:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
replaced getClassNameForRenderer() with getRendererClassName()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
spelling: ArrowHead changed to Arrowhead in method names, enum name, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
move() made recursive, nonrecursive version is called moveLocal()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Pixmap: renamed resize() to setSize()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Transform: skew() methods to use coefficient instead of angle
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Transform: the matrix was transposed so points can be column vectors
     instead of row vectors
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
added NUM_GOOD_DARK_COLORS and NUM_GOOD_LIGHT_COLORS
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
some cPixmapFigure methods were also renamed
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Refined @figure syntax, the way figures can be defined in NED files:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
transform= now accepts "( (a b) (c d) (t1 t2) )" and matrix(a,b,c,d,t1,t2)
     syntaxes as well
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
in transform=, scale() now accepts center as well
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
in transform=, skew() now expects coefficient instead of angle
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
arc, rectangle, image, etc to support bounds=x,t,width,height
     as an alternative to the pos=,size=,anchor= triplet
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Revised the configuration options that control recording of @statistics,
   individual scalars, and histograms. As a result, the **.statistic-recording
   and **.bin-recording options were introduced that take over some of the
   responsibility of the formally overloaded **.scalar-recording option.
   Rationale and details in src/envir/ChangeLog.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added cIEventlogManager, a new Envir plugin class that allows one
   to replace the built-in eventlog manager. Eventlog managers are
   responsible for recording simulation history into an eventlog file.
   A new eventlog manager can be activated with the eventlogmanager-class
   configuration option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The cFingerprint class was renamed to cFingerprintCalculator, and the
   fingerprint-class config option to fingerpringcalculator-class.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In cEnvir, renamed getRNGMappingFor(component) to preconfigure(component).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In cSimulation, moved both updating the event number and simulation time
   into executeEvent(). They were updated inconsistently, plus executeEvent()
   is a better place for that than getNextEvent(), considering cScheduler&#8217;s
   putBackEvent().
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed cEnvir::isDisabled() and added cEnvir::isLoggingEnabled(). Renamed
   cEnvir::disableTracing member variable to cEnvir::loggingEnabled.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cModule: size() deprecated, use getVectorSize() instead
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More methods made virtual in cSimpleModule and other classes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improved the descriptions of several per-object config options.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added a large simulation time and event number display to the toolbar that
   display the *current* simulation time (or the time of the last event), as
   opposed to the time of the next event displayed previously. The status bar
   below the toolbar displays information about the *next* event, together with
   the time delta from the current simulation time. Information on the currently
   set up simulation, along with message statistics, have been moved to the
   bottom status bar of the main window.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Qtenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added a large simulation time and event number display to the toolbar. (This
   is the same GUI change as in Tkenv, see above.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Changed the name of the preferences file to .qtenvrc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Numerous bug fixes and improvements.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cmdenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Configuration options controlling logging in non-express mode
   (cmdenv-express-mode=false) have been simplified. The following options
   have been removed: cmdenv-module-messages, cmdenv-global-log-level,
   **.cmdenv-ev-output. The equivalent functionality (enabling/disabling
   logging and setting the log level globally and per-module) is now
   controlled with **.cmdenv-log-level. Logging can be disabled with
   **.cmdenv-log-level = OFF. Note that the cmdenv-event-banners and
   cmdenv-log-prefix options still exist.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The cmdenv-message-trace configuration option has been removed. It had very
   limited usefulness, and it was somewhat overlapping with eventlog.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Examples:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>

<h2 id="_omnet_5_0_beta_3_december_2015">OMNeT++ 5.0 beta 3 (December 2015)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The highlights of this release are the experimental version of Qtenv (which is
a Qt-based runtime environment that will eventually replace Tkenv), support
for 3D graphics using OpenSceneGraph, and the addition of the much-requested
opp_featuretool utility. The full list follows:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Use of the omnetpp namespace was made permanent. The recommended way of
   porting models is to add the "using namespace omnetpp;" like to header
   files. To compile models without change, add -DAUTOIMPORT_OMNETPP_NAMESPACE
   to the compiler command line.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added 3D graphics support via OpenSceneGraph. The 3D scene graph is to
   be built using the OpenSceneGraph API (e.g. loaded from file via
   osgDB::readNodeFile()), and then set onto a cOsgCanvas instance. 3D scene(s)
   can be visualized in the new Qtenv runtime GUI. (There is no 3D support
   in Tkenv, due to technical limitations.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added resolveResourcePath() to cEnvir and cComponent. The method searches
   a number of folders for a resource given with its file name or relative
   path, and returns the path for the first match. It can useful for locating
   various data files for models, OSG model files, and other files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Visualization: added a method to the base class of modules and channels to
   serve as a container of visualization-related code. refreshDisplay() is
   invoked by graphical user interfaces (Qtenv, Tkenv) whenever GUI contents
   need to be refreshed. Display string updates, canvas figures maintenance,
   and OSG scene graph updates are probably best done inside refreshDisplay()
   methods, as it can result in significant performance gain and, in some
   cases, also in more consistent information being displayed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
An isExpressMode() method has been added to cEnvir to query whether the
   simulation runs in Express mode under a GUI. This information can be useful
   additional input for refreshDisplay() code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The simtime-scale config option has been replaced by simtime-resolution,
   a more user-friendly incarnation. simtime-resolution accepts time units
   (s, ms, us, ns, ps, fs, as), power-of-ten multiples of such a unit (e.g.
   100ms), and also base-10 scale exponents in the -18..0 range (mostly for
   backward compatibility with simtime-scale).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
RNG-to-module mapping made more flexible: the *.rng-&lt;N&gt; config option now
   allows expressions, including those containing index, parentIndex, and
   ancestorIndex(level). This change allows things like assigning a separate
   RNG to each element of a module vector.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fingerprint computation has changed. It was also made more flexible,
   e.g. it is now possible to control which ingredients are added into the
   fingerprint computation. Define USE_OMNETPP4x_FINGERPRINT at compile-time
   to get back OMNeT++ 4.x fingerprints.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Signal listener interface change: A cObject *details argument has been
   added to emit() methods to allow simulation models provide extra information
   with primitive data types (double, long, etc) they emit, without the need
   to switch over to emitting cObject altogether. This is a non-backward-
   compatible change: signal listeners will need to be updated with the extra
   argument. To facilitate transition, you can compile OMNeT++ and models with
   WITH_OMNETPP4x_LISTENER_SUPPORT defined; this will set up cIListener
   to delegate to the old methods, so existing listeners will work.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Result filter/recorder interfaces, being based on signal listeners, have
   undergone a similar change. Models containing custom result filters or
   recorders will need to be updated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
SimTime overhaul to increase accuracy (i.e. use integer arithmetic
   where possible), improve the API, and add missing operations/functions.
   Details:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added missing * and / operators for integral types. This causes
     integer multiplications/divisions to be computed with integer arithmetic
     instead of floating point, resulting in better accuracy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added overflow checking for integer multiplication and negation
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use int64 arithmetic and overflow checking when assigning from integer types
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added isZero()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Replaced "int exponent" with "SimTimeUnit unit" in the two-argument
     constructor (value + unit) and several other methods, with the aim
     of making the API more user-friendly (and model code easier to read).
     Models that call affected methods with integers will need to be
     updated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Moved math functions like fabs(SimTime) into the omnetpp namespace
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added div(SimTime, SimTime); also refined related fmod()'s documentation
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed SIMTIME_RAW(), STR_SIMTIME(), and SIMTIME_TTOA(). These macros are
   no longer needed, as were introduced in OMNeT++ 4.0 to assist porting models
   from version 3.x where simulation time was stored in double. Also, MAXTIME
   was renamed to SIMTIME_MAX.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The tkenv-image-path config option has been replaced with image-path.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
NOTE: The above descriptions have been edited for brevity. More information
   is available in the ChangeLog files (e.g. include/omnetpp/ChangeLog and
   src/sim/ChangeLog), and in doc/API-changes.txt.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Qtenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Qtenv, the Qt-based runtime environment is currently in preview status,
   Tkenv is still the default runtime. Qtenv can be activated by adding the
   '-u Qtenv' switch to simulation command lines. Alternatively, specify
   'PREFER_QTENV=yes' in configure.user to make Qtenv the default GUI.
   Note that 3D visualization is only available in Qtenv.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>SystemC:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Updated the bundled SystemC reference implementation to version 2.3.1
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Examples:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Several new examples (osg-intro, osg-earth, osg-indoor, osg-satellites) have
   been added to the 'samples' folder to demonstrate the new 3D visualization
   capabilities in Qtenv.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Aloha has been updated to use the new refreshDisplay() method.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tools:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added 'opp_featuretool', which is basically the command-line equivalent of
   the Project Features dialog in the IDE: it allows one to enable/disable
   project features defined for an OMNeT++ project, e.g. the INET Framework.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Build:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Because of the new Qtenv runtime environment, OMNeT++ now has several additional
   dependencies: Qt4 is mandatory, while OpenSceneGraph and osgEarth is optional.
   Qtenv can be fully disabled by commenting out the QT_VERSION= variable in the
   configure.user file and then re-running ./configure. Building Qtenv without
   the OpenSceneGraph libraries will disable 3D visualization support in Qtenv.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A separate Mac OS X specific installation bundle was created that contains
   the binary files for all the external dependencies (Tcl/Tk, Qt, OSG, osgEarth etc.)
   As a consequence you no longer have to manually install Quartz before installing
   OMNeT++. We have now separate installation bundles for Linux/Mac/Windows.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The bundled toolchain on Windows has been updated to use MinGW-w64 (32-bit)
   containing both the 'gcc' and 'clang' compilers. The bundle contains all the
   dependencies needed to build OMNeT++ (including Tcl/Tk, Qt4, OpenSceneGraph,
   osgEarth etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Because of the large size of the extra dependencies (Qt, OpenSceneGraph), the
   tools directory is now distributed as a highly compressed archive file inside
   the Windows installation bundle. It is extracted to its final location when
   mingwenv.cmd is first started.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
On systems that have both the 'gcc' and 'clang' compilers installed, OMNeT++
   will pick 'clang' by default. This behavior can be changed by the PREFER_CLANG
   variable in the configure.user file.

OMNeT++ classes are now in the "omnetpp" namespace. Models need to be
    modified to compile, e.g. by adding "using namespace omnetpp" or
    USING_NAMESPACE lines at appropriate places. (The latter conditionally
    expands to the former when needed, and to the empty string when not,
    making your code compatible with OMNeT++ 4.6 too.) If you don&#8217;t want to
    change the model source code, you can define the AUTOIMPORT_NAMESPACE
    macro on the compiler command line (add -DAUTOIMPORT_NAMESPACE to
    CFLAGS), which will basically add the using namespace directive at the
    end of &lt;omnetpp.h&gt;. Turning off the omnetpp namespace (by setting USE_NAMESPACE=no in
    configure.user) is no longer fully supported, and will be removed
    in the next beta.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Introduced cRandom, which encapsulates a random number stream into an
   object. Random numbers can be extracted with the draw() method.
   Added the following cRandom subclasses: cUniform, cExponential,
   cNormal, cTruncNormal, cGamma, cBeta, cErlang, cChiSquare, cStudentT,
   cCauchy, cTriang, cWeibull, cParetoShifted, cIntUniform, cBernoulli,
   cBinomial, cGeometric, cNegBinomial, cPoisson. They encapsulate the
   similarly named functions (e.g. exponential()) with their parameters
   and the random number generator (cRNG). cStatistic also now subclasses
   from cRandom: it can generate a random variate from the distribution
   observed in the collected sample.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Random variate generation functions (normal(), etc.) signature change:
   the trailing "int rng" (RNG index of context module) argument was changed
   to cRNG*, and moved to the front. Motivation: break the functions'
   dependence on the context module. However, to lessen the impact of the signature change, random variate
   generation functions with their original signatures have been added
   to cComponent as methods. Thus, models that only use those functions from
   module methods will not notice any change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The interface of iterators (GateIterator, SubmoduleIterator and
   ChannelIterator in cModule, cQueue::Iterator, etc.) have been changed
   to make them more consistent with STL iterators. Therefore, operator()
   as a means of dereferencing has been deprecated, and operator* and
   operator-&gt; have been added instead. The increment/decrement operators
   have also been revised.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
FES made replaceable. To this end, an abstract cFutureEventSet base class
   has been introduced, and cMessageHeap (now renamed cEventHeap) was made
   to extend cFutureEventSet. An accessor method (cFutureEventSet* getFES())
   has been added to cSimulation, and the older members msgQueue and
   getMessageQueue() have been removed. Simulations now accept a
   'futureeventset-class=&lt;classname&gt;' configuration option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Further refinement of the new canvas API (cCanvas and cFigure + subclasses)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The "simulation" and "ev" macros have been removed, to reduce pollution
   of the global namespace. You can use the newly introduced getSimulation()
   and getEnvir() functions instead.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cObject::parsimPack() has become const. You only need to pay attention
   (and add "const" manually) if you have classes that redefine parsimPack().
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cQueue and cMessageHeap had both length()/getLength() and empty()/isEmpty()
   methods; the former have been removed; use getLength() and isEmpty() instead.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
There have been several other, smaller changes and improvements in many
   classes, e.g. cException, cStatistic, cDensityEstBase, cObjectFactory, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Most methods, typedefs and other items deprecated in previous versions have
   been removed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
See doc/API-changelog.txt for a complete list of changes.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>NED:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Allow a "module" to extend a "simple" (motivation: INET 3.x)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The message compiler no longer appends "_var" to the names of data members
   in generated classes. In cases where this change breaks existing code
   (classes with @customize(true) or with subclasses), you can emulate the
   old behavior by adding the following to the message definition:
   '@fieldNameSuffix("_var");'
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In message compiler generated code, doPacking() has been renamed to
   doParsimPacking(), doUnpacking() to doParsimUnpacking().
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Feature: double-clicking a module in the object tree will open it
   in the main area instead of opening a new inspector window. A new
   inspector can still be opened from the context menu.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added the "Hide namespaces" option in the Preferences dialog that turns off
   the display of the namespace part of C&#x2060;+&#x2060;+ class names when they appear in
   the GUI.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Images under images/old/ are no longer accessible without the "old/"
   prefix, so if you use such an icon, you must add the "old/" prefix
   manually for them to continue to work. For example, you have to change
   "i=cloud" to "i=old/cloud" in display strings. The feature to let old/*
   images be accessible without the prefix was originally introduced to ease
   the transition from OMNeT++ 3.x to 4.0.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Several bug fixes
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>General:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The include/ folder was restructured: only the public header &lt;omnetpp.h&gt; was
   left in it, all other include files were moved into an omnetpp/ subfolder
   under include/.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The source tree (src/) has gone through several modernizing and cleanup steps:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Per-folder nested namespaces have been introduced, e.g. Tkenv code is now
     in the omnetpp::tkenv namespace.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Qualified includes with the folder, i.e. #include "stringutil.h" became
     #include "common/stringutil.h". This increases readability and reduces
     the chance of including a wrong header.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use fully qualified header guards
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Modernizing: use the 'nullptr' and 'override' keywords; use C&#x2060;+&#x2060;+ names of C
     headers (e.g. &lt;cstdio&gt; instead of &lt;stdio.h&gt;).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Code style: renamed many identifiers (local variables, arguments, private
     data members, etc.) to have a consistent, camelcase naming); codebase
     reformatted to have a consistent indentation style.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Clarifications in the Academic Public License.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Contrib:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Removed JSimpleModule due to lack of users and good use cases
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_omnet_5_0_beta_1_feb_2015">OMNeT++ 5.0 beta 1 (Feb 2015)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Core:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added the Canvas API, a figure-based 2D drawing API. The Canvas API allows
   augmenting simulations with graphical elements. Item types include various
   shapes, text and image, including an SVG-like "path" item (a generalized
   polygon/polyline, with arcs and Bezier curves). Transformations (scaling,
   rotation, skewing) are supported, as well as transparency.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New logging API. It features six log levels (FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO,
   DETAIL, DEBUG, TRACE), category support, compile-time and runtime global
   and per-module log level thresholds.
   Also, much more information is passed with each log line to the user
   interface code, allowing one to display a wealth of information in the log
   prefix (log level, file/line, event number, simulation time, module name
  and type, object name and type, and so on).
Incompatibilities:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
lower-case ev&lt;&lt; is no longer legal, use EV&lt;&lt; instead
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ev.printf() was removed, use the stream API (EV&lt;&lt;) instead
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Introduced cEvent as a base class of cMessage. cEvent allows scheduling
   of arbitrary code for a simulation time that runs independent of modules.
   Override the execute() method of cEvent to specify the code. cEvent is
   not intended for use in simulation models; the primary motivation is to
   allow implementing simulation time limit with an "end-simulation" event,
   and to encapsulate foreign events (e.g. SystemC events and crunching)
   for seamless integration with the simulation event loop.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added support for simulation lifecycle listeners. Listeners are called back
   before and after network setup, on network initialization, before and after
   network finalization, and so on. The motivation was to allow more flexibility
   when writing initialization and shutdown code for schedulers, result
   file managers and other extensions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Channel objects made equal to modules in the sense that now they also have
   IDs (the getId() method was moved from cModule to cComponent, the common base
   class of modules and channels), and they are also registered with cSimulation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cTopology improvements:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
added factory methods for links and edges
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
added methods to manipulate the graph (e.g. build a graph from scratch)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Removed int8..int64 and uint8..uint64. Models should use the standard integer
   types from &lt;stdint.h&gt; that end in "_t": int8_t, uint8_t, etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
check_and_cast&lt;&gt; improved; added check_and_cast_nullable&lt;&gt; that accepts NULL
   pointer as input
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New fingerprint computation algorithm. The goal was to make the fingerprint
   less sensitive to uninteresting changes (e.g. removal of an inactive module),
   and more sensitive to interesting ones (e.g. change in packet lengths).
   To get the old fingerprints, define USE_OMNETPP4x_FINGERPRINTS when compiling
   OMNeT++.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cClassDescriptor interface changes (method renaming and arg list changes)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Code cleanup, including:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
removal of 3.x backward compatibility features (WITH_DOUBLE_SIMTIME,
     WITHOUT_CPACKET)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
removal of deprecated classes, functions and macros (cLinkedList,
     cSimulation::operator[], Define_Function(), etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
cTopology: internals refactored (use STL instead of arrays, etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
error code enum members renamed from eXXX to E_XXX
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cmdenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Log lines can now be prefixed with information such as the module
   path; simulation time; event&#8217;s class and object name; file/line
   of the log statement; class, name and pointer of the object
   containing the log statement; etc. The format of this prefix can be
   changed from ini files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New inifile config options: cmdenv-log-format, cmdenv-log-level.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The bgs (background scaling) display string tag has been removed. It was
   originally introduced more or less as a default zoom level, but lost its
   significance since interactive zoom has been introduced.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Zooming no longer affects icon sizes on the screen (but you still have
   the Increase/Decrease Icon Size, Ctrl+I/Ctrl+O menu items in Tkenv).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finished implementation of the Canvas API Tkenv rendering. The
   implementation is based on figure renderers (see FigureRenderer class)
   that can be registered for various figure classes.
   The implementation is based on the Tkpath Tcl/Tk extension, which was
   significantly enhanced by our team.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tkpath is now also used internally for drawing submodules, connections
   and the like. Benefits include:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
unlimited zooming of image backgrounds
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
antialiased drawing (Tk canvas didn&#8217;t have antialiasing)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
OS X: images are no longer forced into 1-bit transparency
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
labels are now outlined (have a "halo") to make them readable on noisy backgrounds
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
range indicator fill is now semi-transparent (because Tkpath supports that)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
performance improvements e.g. on OS X, and with image backgrounds
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Display log prefix; log prefix format and log level configurable via the Options dialog
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>

<h2 id="_omnet_4_6_nov_2014">OMNeT++ 4.6 (Nov 2014)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<p>IMPORTANT:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>To install OMNEST on OS X, you must install both the Apple Java
    support package (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572) and (Oracle) JDK 1.7
    or later (from http://java.com).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tkenv:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improved zooming/panning support: use double click to zoom in around
    a point, and Shift + double click to zoom out; use Ctrl + left mouse
    button to drag out a rectangle to zoom to (a.k.a. marquee zoom;
    implementation based on patch from Christoph Sommer), right-click
    cancels marquee zoom; use left mouse button for panning</p></li>

<li><p>Further small UI fixes (see ChangeLog)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Core:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>The testing tool opp_test has been revised and is now an official part
    of OMNEST.</p></li>

<li><p>The Manual now has a new chapter that covers the testing of simulation
    models as well as the usage of the opp_test tool.</p></li>

<li><p>The message compiler opp_msgc was reimplemented as a part of nedtool.
    opp_msgc still exists as a wrapper script that points to nedtool.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>IDE:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The IDE is now based on Eclipse 4.4 Luna, and requires JDK 1.7 or later.</p></li>

<li><p>The IDE is now a 64-bit application on Mac OS X.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>OMNEST is now using C++11 by default (-std=c++11) when models are compiled.
    The simulator itself does not use any of the C++11 features, so C++11 support may
    be disabled in configure.user. Update your models to compile properly using the
    C++11 standard, as later OMNEST versions will require C++11 compliance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>OMNEST can be configured to use the 'omnetpp' namespace by setting
    USE_NAMESPACE=yes in configure.user</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clang compiler support: Clang is used by default on OS X, and can be turned
    on on Linux. Clang is still not supported on Windows (we are waiting for the
    MSYS Clang packages to mature).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bundled MSYS/MinGW toolchain was updated to use MSYS2. MSYS2 resolves
    a number of issues:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>No more memory errors during build</p></li>
    <li><p>The make command now properly supports parallel build (-j4, -j8 etc.)</p></li>
    <li><p>The bundled MSYS2 toolchain now contains the pacman package manager,
        so you can install additional packages if you wish</p></li>
    <li><p>Change in OMNEST: The msys/ directory has been moved to tools/win32/ while
        the mingw/ directory that contains the compiler has been moved to
        tools/win32/mingw32/.</p></li>

<p>
    Support for optional signal checking. When signal checking is turned on,
    signals emitted by modules/channels must be declared with a @signal property
    in the module&#8217;s or channel&#8217;s NED description; undeclared signals will result
    in a runtime error. Signal declarations are of the form
</p>
<div class="listingblock">

<div class="paragraph"><p>&lt;signalName&gt; may contain wildcards (?,*). Type is optional; if present,

</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Support for @statistic-style declarative result recording on dynamically
    registered signals (e.g. "conn-&lt;n&gt;" where n is an integer). Instead of
    @statistic, add a @statisticTemplate property in the NED file, and for
    each new signal call ev.addResultRecorders(...).
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Support for programmatically adding result filters and recorders on
    signals: cResultRecorder has been revised to allow result recorders
    to be used without a corresponding @statistic attribute, e.g. they
    can now be added to signals programmatically.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Further signals-related changes:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>
introduced SimsignalType which replaces the older cITimestampedValue::Type

</li>
<li>
<p>
added cObjectFactory::isInstance() method that effectively wraps a
      dynamic_cast
</p>
</li>
<li>

added Register_Abstract_Class() macro that allows abstract classes to be
      used in signal declarations as type.

More freedom in NED property syntax: (1) Hyphens, dots and colons are now
    allowed in property names and indices; and (2) values no longer need
    to be enclosed in quotes if they contain parens, provided that parens are
    balanced.

<li>
<p>
Support for project-specific images: icons from the "images/" folder of the

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The IDE was made more friendly to first-time users:</p></div>


<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
When the IDE is started with an empty workspace (e.g. on first-time
launch), it offers the user the following options: (1) Import the OMNeT++
sample simulations into the workspace; and (2) Download and install the
INET Framework.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The latter function is also available via the Help > Install Simulation
Models... menu item. The menu item brings up a dialog with the list of
simulation models available for automated installation, and lets the user
choose. Currently only the INET Framework is listed there, but it is
planned to add further models.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When the IDE is started for the first time, it now displays some helpful
introductory pages in the editor area: "Getting Started" (practical
advice for getting past the first 10 minutes spent in the IDE);
"At a Glance" (explains the common file types like NED, msg and ini, and
their purposes); "OMNeT++ Samples" (describes each example simulation in
two sentences, then provides links for opening the project, viewing the
README, launching the simulation, etc.) These pages are also available
from the Help system (except the last one, which has a dedicated menu item
under the Help menu.)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Further IDE improvements:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
IDE launcher script: fixed #670 (vmargs conflict between omnetpp.ini and
    the launcher script). This bug could cause IDE crashes by PermGenSpace
    exhaustion.

</li>
<li>
<p>
Analysis Tool, Output Vector View: show "Go to" actions in the context
    menu (instead of the view&#8217;s pulldown menu)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Analysis Tool: fixed #389 (Useless items in the Statistic Name filter):

<div class="paragraph"><p>Ini files:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Ini files: iterations (${&#8230;}) can now refer to other iteration variables,
   improvement makes it possible to have loops where the inner iteration range
   depends on the outer one. When needed, the default top-down nesting order
   of iteration loops is modified (loops are reordered) to ensure that
   expressions only refer to more outer loop variables, but not to inner ones.
   When this is not possible, an error is generated with the "circular
   dependency" message. Variables are substituted textually, and the text
   resulting from substitution is NOT evaluated except in the '&lt;from&gt;..&lt;to&gt;
   step &lt;step&gt;' syntax, and in the 'constraint=' ini file option. CAUTION:
   textual substitution means that variables in arithmetic expressions should
   be protected with parentheses. The text substitution model was chosen for
   greater flexibility as well as the ability to produce a more consistent
   semantics. See src/envir/ChangeLog for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Incompatible change: In the constraint= configuration option, variables now
   be surrounded with parens (to ensure precedence after the textual variable
   substitution). For example, the expression x+y&lt;10 must be changed to
   $x+$y&lt;10, or for greater safety, to ($x)+($y)&lt;10.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Parallel iteration: it is now supported to use named iteration
   variables and parallel iteration together ($&#8230;!bar syntax.)
   This was not supported previously.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Some iteration-related error messages have been improved to provide
   more context.

Result filter/recorder interfaces and registration macros made public
   (moved to src/sim), so that users can contribute their own result filters
   and recorders. Files: cresultlistener.h, cresultfilter.h  cresultrecorder.h.
   Result filters have to be subclassed from cResultFilter or the more specific
   cNumericResultFilter or cObjectResultFilter base classes and registered with
   the Register_ResultFilter() macro; result recorders have to be subclassed
   from cResultRecorder or the more specific cNumericResultRecorder, and
   registered with the Register_ResultRecorder() macro. After that, the new
   filter or recorder can be used in the source= and record= attributes of
   @statistic, and with the **.result-recording-modes configuration option.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Define_Function() macros have been renamed to Define_NED_Math_Function().
   For backwards compatibility, the old macro definitions remain, but issue
   a deprecation warning. Note that the preferred way of defining new NED
   functions is now the Define_NED_Function() macro.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The API for custom NED functions defined via Define_NED_Function() has been
   changed. cDynamicExpression::Value (the old value class) has been factored
   out to a new cNEDValue class. Data members are no longer public, they can
   be manipulated via various methods. NOTE: This change is NOT backwards
   compatible: user-supplied NED functions will need to be revised.
   Look at src/sim/nedfunctions.cc for code examples.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Measurement unit support: added "mps" (m/s) and "kmph" (km/h) as recognized
   units; changed "Kbps" to more standards compilant "kbps"; changed byte
   multiples notation to use the now-standard IEC binary prefixes: KB -&gt; KiB,
   MB -&gt; MiB, GB -&gt; GiB, TB -&gt; TiB. The latter changes affect backwards
   compatibility, i.e. you may need to update existing models.

opp_run: bugfix: release-mode simulation models compiled as shared libraries
   could not be run using a debug-mode opp_run program (they either crashed
   or reported that a module was not registered with the Register_Module()
   macro.) As part of the fix, a new opp_run_release program has been
   introduced, and opp_run (which is now always compiled as debug) delegates
   to it when necessary.
      Due to makefile changes related to the fix, you may need to re-create the
   makefiles of your simulation when upgrading to OMNeT++ 4.2. (You only need
   to do that when working on the command line. The IDE automatically recreates
   the makefiles, so no action is needed on your part if you are using only the
   IDE.) See src/envir/ChangeLog for details of this change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Implemented number filter expressions using multiple inputs for statistics source
   expressions. For example:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>@statistic[dropRate](source="count(packetDropped)/count(packetSent)");</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
opp_msgc: improvement: announcements and type definitions now observe
   whether they are above the namespace declaration (=outside the namespace)
   or below it (=inside the namespace). This change makes it consistent with
   cplusplus blocks that had this behavior for quite some time. A related
   improvement is that type lookup in namespaces has been modified to make it
   possible to use unqualified names when declaring fields. See
   src/nedxml/ChangeLog for details.

<p>
Before running the simulations, the IDE will show the command line in
   the console view to help you execute the same simulation from the
   command line.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ctrl-Tab now works on freshly opened NED files even if you do not explicitly
   select a simple module. In that case, the IDE opens the .h and .cc files
   associated with the first simple module in the NED file.
</p>
</li>
<li>

Improvement on the Manage Build Configurations dialog: newly created build
   configurations are now configured, by copying the source entries from one
   of the existing build configurations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Project Makemake Options property page: overhaul for better usability.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Documentation generator: turn on JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF in newly generated
   doxy.cfg files. (When this option is on, there is no need for @brief
   in C++ doxy comments; instead the first sentence of the comment is taken
   automatically as brief description.)

Bug fixes on: IDE makefile generator; the Project Features feature;
   the Inifile Editor (hover info, content assist, etc); the NED editor

<div class="paragraph"><p>Most important feature: "Project Features" (see below).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>NED:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added support for conditional submodules. Syntax:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>udp: UDP if needsUDP {...}
tcp: &lt;tcpType&gt; like ITCP if needsTCP {...}</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added the xml() NED function, which accepts a string argument and parses
   it as XML. Its most notable use is eliminating "empty.xml" files from INET:
   one can use xml("&lt;root/&gt;") in NED files instead.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Implemented default value for parametric submodule and channel types.
   NED now supports the following syntax:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>mobility: &lt;default("NullMobility")&gt; like IMobility;</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<p>The effect is that the NullMobility NED type will be used for the mobility
submodule if the type name is not specified otherwise, e.g. in the config-
uration with something like</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>**.mobility.type-name = "ConstSpeedMobility"</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added the firstAvailable() NED function, which is helpful with the Project
   Features feature (see below). It accepts any number of strings (see new
   varargs support for NED functions), interprets them as NED type names
   (either short names or fully qualified names), and returns the first one
   that exists and is also "available" (its C++ implementation class exists).
   Example usage:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>tcp: &lt;default(firstAvailable("TCP_lwIP", "TCP_NSC", "TCP"))&gt; {..}</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<p>It chooses the TCP_lwIP, TCP_NSC or TCP module type for the tcp submodule,
in this order, unless the type is explicitly defined to be something else
in the configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Parametric submodule type can now also be specified in NED files, using
   patterns that end in the new "typename" keyword. An example:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>network Net {
    parameters:
        host[*].tcp.typename = "TCP_lwIP";
    ...
}</tt></pre>

</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ini files:</p></div>

Implemented varargs support for NED functions. If the signature (see
   Define_NED_Function() and Define_NED_Function2() macros) ends in ", &#8230;",
   then the function will accept any number of additional arguments of any type.
   At runtime, the implementation has access to both the actual number and
   types of args. When passing extra args, optional arguments (those marked
   with '?' in the signature) must all be present, i.e. varargs can only come
   when all typed args are there.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Upgraded to Eclipse 3.6.2
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Implemented the "Project Features" feature, which makes it possible to
   disable unused parts ("features") of a project to reduce compilation time
   and complexity. It has been invented to help INET Framework users and
   developers deal with the growing size of the framework. Features are
   described in the project&#8217;s .oppfeatures file, authored by INET developers.
   Users can activate/deactivate features in the Project Features page of
   the Project Properties dialog (this page is directly accessible from the
   Project menu and from the Build Configurations submenu of the project&#8217;s
   context menu in Project Explorer). Features map to NED packages and C++
   source folders; disabling a feature maps to NED package exclusion, and
   folder exclusion in CDT (C++ Development) configuration. Features can also
   define C/C++ symbols (for #ifdefs), and extra libraries to link with.
   At build time, the IDE checks the project&#8217;s configuration (NED, CDT) and
   if it is inconsistent with the selected features, it offers fixing it.
   Features can also be used from the command line by exporting Makefiles
   (or opp_makemake commands) that reflect a particular enablement of features.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for excluding (disabling) NED packages. This feature is needed for
   the Project Features feature. Exclusions can be edited on the NED Source
   Folders project property page, and are saved into the project&#8217;s .nedfolders
   file.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Animation Player:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Implemented lazy loading of the eventlog file: the tool can now animate
   large eventlog files with acceptable performance.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Animation effects refined, e.g. packet transmission on a datarate channel.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Heavy bugfixing. Note that the tool is still being actively developed, and
   it is generally not yet ready for everyday use.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Inifile Editor:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Usability: the editor now comes up with the page (text or form) that was
   used last time, and not always with the form editor. (When you flip the
   editor to the other page, the page type is stored in the preferences.
   When an editor is opened, the setting is read from the preferences and
   the corresponding page is activated.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improved text hover (F2) and hyperlink (Ctrl+click) support: the editor
   can now show information and go to the definition of modules that occur
   in the inifile key. For example, for a **.host[*].tcp.sackSupport = true
   line, the user can hover over (or Ctrl+click) the host[*] part, and the
   editor will show relevant information and go to the definition of the
   host[] submodule vector in the NED network description.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improved content assist: per-object configuration options are now filtered
   by the type of object that the key refers to; for example, if you type
   **.ppp[*].txPkBytes.&lt;Ctrl+Space&gt;, the editor will know from the NED files
   that txPkBytes is a statistic, and offer completions accordingly.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Content assist: different types of completions (modules, parameters,
   statistics, configuration options, etc) are now marked with icons.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Markers on included inifiles are now removed when the main inifile is
   closed. (Fix for #176)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added the Copy action to the Module Parameters view context menu: you can
   now select the key for an unassigned parameter in the view, and copy/paste
   it into the editor area.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Wizards:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
New Tictoc Example and New Source-Sink Example wizards: fix: the root
   Makefile executed opp_makemake in the src/ folder at each build,
   overwriting the IDE-generated Makefile.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New OMNeT++ Project wizard template: now it is possible to set "custom make"
   for a folder: specify &lt;foldername&gt;:CUSTOM in the makemakeOptions= template
   variable in template.properties. Use "." to name the project root folder.
   Example: makemakeOptions = .: CUSTOM, src: --deep -meta:recurse&#8230;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New option for template.properties: preRunTemplate=&lt;fti-file-name&gt;. Example:
   preRunTemplate = main.fti. The option causes the given template file to be
   evaluated for its side effects, just after the user hits Finish but before
   any file is copied or template is evaluated. It is not allowed to produce
   text output, but the variables it sets will be substituted into other
   template.properties variables, and will also be available in other template
   files. (Note: all other templates are run in isolation, and cannot change
   variables for other templates!) The preRunTemplate option is the only way
   to programmatically set the value of makemakeOptions and similar
   template.properties options.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Graphical Editor:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Switched back double-click behavior to Open NED Type action. The Properties
   dialog can now opened with Ctrl+Enter (Alt+Enter was unavailable.)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Sequence Chart and Event Log:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added show/hide options for arrows that represent mixed dependencies.
   (Such arrows are drawn when the sequence chart is filtered, and represent
   e.g. a sequence of message sendings and self-messages)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Eventlog: enhanced performance of event tracing filter
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Simulations now record the termination message and result code into the
   eventlog file
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Note: eventlog file format has changed (in order to better serve the
   Animation Tool)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;.elog files recorded with any prior version of OMNeT++
   have to be re-recorded.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Many bug fixes, mostly in the IDE; you can see the detailed list at:

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Partial list of changes since 4.1 (see ChangeLog files in individual folders
for a more complete list):</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Simulation runtime:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Removed #include &lt;winsock.h&gt; from &lt;platdep/timeutil.h&gt;; the reason
   is that it conflicted with lwIP code recently integrated into INET.
   &lt;platdep/sockets.h&gt; still includes &lt;winsock.h&gt;, but now
   &lt;platdep/sockets.h&gt; (and &lt;platdep/timeutil.h&gt;) MUST precede &lt;omnetpp.h&gt;
   in all source files.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ini files: implemented multiple inheritance for sections. Syntax:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>[Config Foobar]
extends = Foo, Bar</tt></pre>
</div></div>
<p>When the runtime looks for a config option or param assignment, sections
are examined in a "fallback order" until the first match is found. In the
above example the order would be: Foobar, Foo, Bar, General.
OMNeT++ uses C3 linearization to compute the section fallback order,
see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ini files: better parsing for iteration variables, e.g. the value in
   $uniform(1,2) is now parsed as one item, not as "uniform(1" and "2)".
   Nested parens/brackets/braces and string literals are recognized;
   escaping commas and close-braces is now possible using backslash.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
NED: fixed deep parameter assignments: parameter references were
   interpreted in the wrong context. Deep parameter assignments are when
   an inifile-like pattern is used to name the parameter(s) to be set, as in:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt>network Inet {
    parameters:
        host[*].tcp.nagleEnabled = true;
    ...
}</tt></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Resolved spurious errors: 'Class "&#8230;" not found&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;perhaps its code
   was not linked in, or the class wasn&#8217;t registered with Register_Class()'
   Added a check to ensure that the debug and the release versions of
   the simulation library are not loaded at the same time. This problem
   occurred when a model was built as 'release' and the debug version of
   'opp_run' was used to start it. As a result, the simulation seemingly
   started but complained about missing classes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix: Some classes were thrown out by the linker if OMNeT++ was statically
   built, and the simulation was complaining at runtime about the missing
   cCompoundModule class.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Eventlog recording: .elog file format change: message creations and
   duplications (cloning) are now recorded; MC (ModuleCreated) entries now
   precede GC (GateCreated) entries. IMPORTANT: The sequence chart in the
   IDE will only work on .elog files in the new format, existing event logs
   need to be re-recorded!
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Animation Player:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
This is a new component in the IDE, you can access it by right-clicking
   an .elog file and selecting "Open With / OMNeT++ Animation Player" from
   the context menu. This is a preliminary implementation (Technology
   Preview) not yet optimized for large files, the practical maximum file
   size it can handle is about 10MB.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/C++ Development:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added a new "Clean Local" item to the project&#8217;s context menu that does
   not clean referenced projects. This resolves the problem that CDT&#8217;s
   "Clean Project" command also cleans the referenced projects, e.g. if
   you have a Foo project that depends on INET, cleaning Foo also cleans
   INET which takes a long time to recompile. Now you can use the
   "Clean Local" command to clean Foo only.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added new "OMNeT++ Code Formatter" profile. This coding convention follows
   the rules used in the OMNeT++ kernel and the INET Framework. (No tabs, etc.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added MachO64 binary parsers and error parsers. This makes it possible to
   debug a 64-bit executable on Mac OS X 10.6
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Linux only: Added support for profiling with Valgrind. To activate this
   feature, select "Profile as&#8230; / OMNeT++ Simulation" from the Project
   Explorer context menu. This feature requires Valgrind to be installed
   on your system. (Note: the main IDE toolbar does not show a Profile button
   next to the Run and Debug buttons at this time, but profiling is still
   available via the Project Explorer context menu.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Makemake page in Project Properties can now fix the "Source Folders
   differ across configurations" problem in the project setup, which usually
   occurs when you add a build configuration to an existing project later.
   The dialog now displays a "Fix it" link.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Graphical Editor:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Several performance optimizations for the NED Editor. It can open much larger
   files than before. NED validation is done now in a background thread and
   does not block the UI.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Select 'NED Type Selection' dialog now works correctly on first open. It
   shows the defining projects for the types.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Enhanced drag and drop capabilities in NED Graphical Editor. You can
   drop NED types into a compound module either to create submodules
   (if you drop it into the submodule area), or to turn it into
   an inner type (if you drop on the title of the compound module).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Graphical Editor now displays the file&#8217;s package name at the top.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Graphical Editor displays self-connections as arcs in the module&#8217;s upper
   right corner.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The resize/move feedback figures have been changed from a simple outline
   to translucent blue.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added a 'Properties' dialog that can edit one or several objects
   at a time, and allows you to change graphical and type information.
   It also has a preview panel.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Enhanced editing of type fields in the 'Property View'. The editor correctly
   enumerates the possible choices and adds an import statement if necessary.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
'Open Type' and 'Open Supertype' have been reassigned to the F3 function key.
   Double-click now opens the 'Properties' dialog.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The IDE now uses the use native (C++) layouter code for placing unpinned
   submodules, which means better performance and consistency with the
   simulation runtime (Tkenv).
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Inifile Editor:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Support for inifile improvements in this release, namely multiple section
   inheritance and better parsing for iteration variables
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Performance improvements: inifile is now analyzed in the background so that
   it does not block the UI, and features that need its results (hover text,
   content assist, etc) have a timeout how long they are willing to wait for it
   (see bug #132 for details). It is now also possible to disable inifile
   analysis. Further performance and UI responsiveness improvements are planned.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Sequence Chart:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added 'Go to Simulation Time' and 'Go to Event Number' in the context menu.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
'Go to Simulation Time' in the 'Event Log' view now supports relative values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Sequence Chart tool now knows about message creations and duplications
   (cloning), and as a result, in certain situations it is now able to better
   identify relationships between events and draw a better sequence chart.
   NOTE: Due to changes in the .elog file format, the tool will only work with
   newly recorded files. Existing event logs need to be re-recorded!
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Launcher:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The command-line for launching the simulation now uses relative paths instead
   of absolute ones. This makes the starting command-line easier to understand.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>IDE/Documentation Generator:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added tilde notation as an alternative to automatic hyperlinking of module
   names in comments. The latter was often too aggressive (e.g. linking to the
   IP module in the phrase "IP address" is wrong). Automatic hyperlinking can
   now be turned off in the generator, and then the user is expected to mark
   words to be hyperlinked with a tilde: "the ~IP module". The INET Framework
   has already been converted to use the tilde notation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added Javascript to autoload frameset page if a content page is opened by
   itself. This is useful when URLs to specific content pages are posted on
   the mailing list or sent over email.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Implemented @include in NED comments. Lines in the included file don&#8217;t have
   to start with "//", but otherwise they are processed exactly as NED comment
   text.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix: External pages (@externalpage) now appear under the "Selected Topics"
   node of the navigation tree in the generated documentation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Several minor fixes: recognize the &lt;u&gt; (underline) HTML tag; sanitize the
   file names for @page; added/refined test cases
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tkenv:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Parallel simulation: Placeholder modules are now displayed with a semi-
   transparent icon (or if it&#8217;s a rectangle or oval, with dotted border).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix (bug #248): compute coordinates (and sizes) in double and not int;
   necessary if background scaling (bgs display string tag) is set up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Better choice of default user interface font, especially on Linux.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The generic UI font and the font used in graphics are now configurable
   in the Simulation Options dialog.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The default font for log text is now proportional (same as the generic UI
   font), for better readability and space efficiency. It can be customized
   (switched back to a monospace font, etc) in the Simulation Options dialog.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Minor: menu items have been changed to title case
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tcl errors are now logged into .tkenvlog instead of dumping them on stdout.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Misc:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Added -g option to 'scavetool scalar' command. You can specify how the
   scalars are grouped into columns/variables.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The build system can now build large projects on windows. The 32K command-line
   limitation has been resolved.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Updated base system to Eclipse 3.6.1
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added a detailed IDE change log file doc/IDE-Changes
</p>
</li>
